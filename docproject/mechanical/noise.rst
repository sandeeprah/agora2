Noise Attenuation with Distance
-------------------------------

Calculate Sound Pressure Level (SPL) at a distance R2 when the sound pressure level at distance R1 is known. The source of sound can be either a point, a line or a planar wall.

Common Noise Conversions
------------------------

Calculate Sound Pressure Level if Sound Power Level, distance and directivity factor are known.
Calculate Sound Power Level if Sound Pressure Level, distance and directivity factor are known.
Calculate distance if Sound Pressure Level, Sound Power Level and directivity factor are known.

A-weighting of Noise Spectrum
-----------------------------

Get A-weighted noise spectrum from unfiltered noise spectrum.

Background Noise Correction
---------------------------

Get corrected noise levels from total noise levels and background noise levels. Correction can be performed either on the overall noise levels or on spectrum levels.

Noise map due to multiple noise sources
---------------------------------------

Get noise levels on a predifined area(grid) due to multiple noise sources located on ground. Inputs include the sound power level, directivity factor and the x & y coordinate locations.

Noise Addition
--------------

Perform logarithmic addition of noise levels. Sound pressure levels at a point can be added up using logarithmic addition. Similarly if addition of sound power levels for various octave bands is done, the overall sound power level can be obtained.
