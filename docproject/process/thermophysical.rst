Chemical Fluid
--------------

The inputs include state variables of pressure and temperature. Outputs include several properties including critical presssure, temperature, acentric factor, specific volume, enthalphy, entropy, internal energy, specific heat, global warming potential, ozone depletion potential etc,

Water/Steam
-----------

The inputs include state variables of pressure and temperature for determination of properties for superheated steam or compressed water. For saturated state the inputs required are Pressure-Quality or Temperature-Quality. Outputs include phase information, saturation temperature or pressure and specific volume, enthalphy, entropy, internal energy etc.

Hydrocarbon/Gas Mixture
-----------------------

The inputs include state variables of pressure and temperature. Typical composition list of API 617 gas compressors is used. The input include state variables of pressure and temperature. The outputs include crtiical pressure, temperature, compressibility factor (Z), ideal gas specific heat etc. The compressibility factor is determined using Nelson-Obert, LeeKesler and PengRobinson equation of state.
