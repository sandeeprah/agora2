Determine pump performance on viscous liquid when water performance is known
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Calculation based on Hydraulic Institute Standard, ANSI/HI 9.6.7. Inputs include flow, head, efficiency,speed, best efficiency point head and flow for water along with viscosity value. Outputs include correction factors on head, flow and efficiency and the viscous head and flow.
