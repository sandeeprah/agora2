Fired Heater Efficiency Measurements
====================================

This calculation helps in the measurement of efficiency of fired process heaters. The calculation is currently applicable to gaseous fuel based Fired Heaters. Inputs used are ambient conditions such as temperature and humidity, assumptive radiation losses, flue gas exit temperatures, flue gas oxygen content, fuel gas composition and fuel supply temperatures. Oxygen sampling is supported on 'wet basis' as well as 'dry basis'. Outputs include, Flue gas composition by consituent mass per mass of fuel gas burned, net thermal efficiency, gross thermal efficiency and fuel efficiency.
